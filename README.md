## Abstract

## Research Questions
- Can natural disasters be observed through the quotes of the Quotebank dataset ?
- Is it possible to recreate a spatial and temporal map of natural disasters with the quotes, that is close to what really happend ?
- Does the speakers and quotes semantic help us conclude something on the involvments concerning disaters handling  or climate ? (CHANGE??)

## Additional datasets
Natural disasters in US, seems easy to use </br >

International, maybe better/more precise

This dataset contains all natural disasters in the US from 1953 to 2021, with most notably the exact date, location and type of disaster. It can be used to compare with the outcome of our observations on the natural disasters through the quotes.
